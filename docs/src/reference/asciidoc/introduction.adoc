Spring Security Kerberos is an extension of Spring Security for
application developers to Kerberos concepts with Spring.

== Requirements

Spring Security Kerberos {revnumber} is built and tested with JDK 7,
Spring Security {spring-security-version} and Spring Framework {spring-version}.

====
Java 8 Update 40/45 had a regression which broke handling of Kerberos tokens.
These Java versions are no longer supported.
